# My RESTful API

My RESTful API is a sample project demonstrating the implementation of a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing products.

## Requirements

Develop a RESTful API that adheres to REST standards.

Utilize GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH methods.
Adhere to HTTP status code standards.
Implement an Error Handler to provide standard formats for 500, 400, 404, 200, and 201 errors.
Perform mandatory field checks in models.
Use routing for better organization.
Demonstrate model binding processes from both the request body and query parameters.
Bonus: In addition to standard CRUD operations, include listing and sorting functionalities. For example, /api/products/list?name=abc.
